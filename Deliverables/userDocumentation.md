1. Project Specifics 
---
The Smart Energy Analytic Disaggregation System (SEADS) is a smart sensor powered energy monitoring device capable of data collection and meaningful end-user energy usage analysis. The SEADS project is served to end point users through a responsive user interface created with the goal of providing an optimal user experience in which ease of use and accessible energy analysis modules are paramount.

2. Requirements for Use
---
Use of the SEADS system requires possession of the SEADS energy-monitoring device and access to a web browser of your choice. Once on the web interface, a registered user account is needed to add devices and monitor data usage. 

3. Quick Start User Guide
---
1. Navigate to http://sead.systems in a web browser to gain access to the SEADS web application.

2. Register an account by clicking on the “register” button in the upper right hand corner. Once on the registration page:
  * Enter basic user information including “first name”, “last name”,  “email address“, phone number”, and “phone carrier”.
  * Enter a secure password.
  * Click the “register” button below the form to finish the registration process.
  * Subsequent site visits require logging in with the account information specified in this form.

3. Forgotten passwords and account details can be recovered by visiting the “forgotten account details” link on the sign in page.

4. Add new devices by visiting the “dashboard” page, accessible from the top left corner of the site navigation bar. From the “dashboard” page:
  * Current registered devices will be listed in a grid format in which basic kilowatt-hour usage and connection status are viewable.
  * There is an “add device” icon below the device grid. Clicking this icon will bring up the device registration form. 
  * Devices require a numerical “device id” (located on your SEADS plug) and a user-friendly “device name”.

5. Removing specific devices can be accomplished by clicking the delete button in the device module, located on the “dashboard” page.

6. View live data visualizations for specific registered devices by clicking the corresponding device module from the “dashboard” page.

7. Drag over a section of the graph to zoom in on the data.

8. Use the drop down menu in the top-right to download a csv, xls, png, jpeg, svg of the current data displayed by the graph.

9.  Adjust the granularity of the graph with the slider top-right to change the number of points used when drawing the graph for a given range.

10. Use the date pickers bottom-left to manually select a date range to display on the graph
